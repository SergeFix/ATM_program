Life is a waterfall
We're one in the river
And one again after the fall

Swimming through the void
We hear the word
We lost ourselves, but we find it all...

Cause we are the ones that want to play
Always want to go, but you never wanna stay
And we are the ones that want to choose
Always want to play, but you never want to lose

Aerials, in the sky
When you lose small mind
You free your life

Life is a waterfall
We drink from the river
Then we turn around and put up our walls

Swimming through the void

We hear the word
We lost ourselves but we find it all...
